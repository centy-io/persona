# Configure pre-push hook

## Overview
Wire full CI-grade quality checks into the Husky `pre-push` hook so that nothing is pushed to remote unless it passes all checks — including coverage thresholds.

## Tasks
- Create or update `.husky/pre-push` script
- Add the following checks in order:
  1. `npm run build` — TypeScript compilation
  2. `npm run test:coverage` — full test suite with 100% coverage enforcement
- Ensure the hook exits with a non-zero code if any check fails, blocking the push
- Document the hook behavior in the project README or CONTRIBUTING guide

## Acceptance Criteria
- Pushing code that fails TypeScript compilation is blocked
- Pushing code that falls below 100% test coverage is blocked
- The hook script is executable and committed to `.husky/pre-push`

## Dependencies
- Husky must be set up (issue #6)
- 100% coverage enforcement must be configured (issue #11)
