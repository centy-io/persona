# Implement `init` command

## Overview
Implement the `persona init` command. This is the core feature of the CLI. It registers two custom item types with the centy daemon for the current project: `persona` and `story`.

## Item Type Definitions

### `persona`
Represents a user persona — a fictional character that embodies a user segment.
Suggested fields:
- title (built-in)
- body / description (built-in)
- role (custom field, string)
- goals (custom field, string)
- pain-points (custom field, string)

### `story`
Represents a user story tied to a persona.
Suggested fields:
- title (built-in)
- body (built-in, markdown — "As a [persona], I want...")
- persona (custom field, reference or string)
- acceptance-criteria (custom field, markdown)

## Tasks
- Create `src/commands/init.ts` as an oclif command
- Use the daemon client to call the centy item-type creation API for both types
- Show clear success/error output for each type created
- Handle the case where the types already exist gracefully (idempotent)
- Add a `--project` flag to target a specific project path (default: cwd)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Running `persona init` in a centy-tracked project creates both `persona` and `story` item types
- Running it twice does not error — idempotent behavior
- Help text (`persona init --help`) is clear and accurate
