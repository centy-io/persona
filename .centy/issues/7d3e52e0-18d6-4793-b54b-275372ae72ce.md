# Add Husky for Git hooks management

## Overview
Set up [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to manage Git hooks in a consistent, cross-platform way. Husky ensures that all contributors run the same hooks automatically on relevant Git events.

## Tasks
- Install `husky` as a dev dependency
- Initialize Husky (`husky init`) to create the `.husky/` directory
- Add the `prepare` script in `package.json` to install hooks automatically after `npm install`
- Create `.husky/pre-commit` and `.husky/pre-push` hook files (to be wired in follow-up issues)
- Ensure `.husky/` directory is committed to source control

## Acceptance Criteria
- `husky` is listed in `devDependencies`
- Running `npm install` auto-installs hooks via the `prepare` script
- `.husky/` directory exists and is tracked in git
- Git hooks execute when triggered (pre-commit, pre-push)
