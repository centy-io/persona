# Configure pre-commit hook

## Overview
Wire all pre-commit quality checks into the Husky `pre-commit` hook so they run automatically before every commit.

## Tasks
- Create or update `.husky/pre-commit` script
- Add the following checks in order:
  1. `npm run lint` — ESLint
  2. `npm run lint:spell` — cspell
  3. `npm run test` — unit tests (fast, no coverage threshold needed here)
- Ensure the hook exits with a non-zero code if any check fails, blocking the commit
- Add a clear error message guiding the developer to fix issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- Committing code with lint errors is blocked
- Committing code with spelling errors is blocked
- Committing code with failing tests is blocked
- The hook script is executable and committed to `.husky/pre-commit`

## Dependencies
- Husky must be set up (issue #6)
- cspell must be configured (issue #7)
- ESLint must be configured (issue #8)
